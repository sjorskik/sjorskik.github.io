# Mixbus Bared

-2025-12-16

## Stock sound generators

So what does Mixbus 11 (_not_ Pro) have to offer in the sense of internal/stock plugins that generate sounds for us? Not much really. Most of it comes from the opensource Ardour on which Mixbus is based, and two of them I can't even get any sound from.

These include Signal Generator and SinGen, I simply can't get any sound from them, transport running, using a MIDI keyboard. I simply don't know, although they don't really sound _that_ interesting, so I shouldn't worry about them too much.

## Do generate sound

The stock plugins that do generate sound without too much hassle are ACE DTMF Phone, ACE Fluid Synth, ACE Reasonable Synth, setBfree DSP Tonewheel Organ.

### ACE DTMF Phone

Exactly as it says, synthesizes DTMF tones. Sure, you could use this, what, once in your lifetime? So the question does begs for 'Why?!?!'

### ACE Fluid Synth

A SF2 player, so essentially a rompler. Never been a fan of SoundFonts, but hey, Your Mileage May Vary (YMMV).

### ACE Reasonable Synth

So with that name you think 'ha! finally something reasonable' but it's nothing like that really. It's just the synth that will always put out the same sound, with nothing else, so more of a case of 'is my setup working or not'. So absolutely uninteresting for creating music, because of the single preset and not much to manipulate it with, other than effects and the like.

### setBfree DSP Tonewheel Organ

Well, essentially this is a working tonewheel organ, but the interface is so incredibly old, unworkable to a point, but it does sound okay with even a leslie speaker (if you can find the controls for it).

## Drumkits

There's a choice even here, Black Pearl, Blonde Bop (Hotrod) and Red Zeppelin. All probably romplers, analog drums, with optional multi-outs and they sounds perfectly okay for your bedroom producing.

## General MIDI Synth

But lookie here, this is a treasure. Sure, not a synthesizer per se, as you don't have any control over the synthesized sound, but you could be well forgiven to think it sounds like a Roland D-10/SC-880 or something. Good generic and general sounds and bring them to life with the stock effect plugins and you can quickly get going with something. It even features a 808/909 preset!
