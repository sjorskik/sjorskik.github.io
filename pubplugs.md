# Plugin list

[< Mixbus Bared](mixbusbared.html) | Wanted to get my extensive plugin list out in the open _(2025-12-17)_ | [Finally Published >](pubplugs2.html)

I've took it upon myself to get a list up, mostly for myself, to list a plugin with some flags and a short description of it, and if I wanted it installed, maybe, or not.

This list grew out of control and had multiple tags scattered throughout it, so I made it a MarkDown table and added some fields to place those flags in a bit more accessible way.

Then I thought it would be nice to have a certain sorting, based on Vendor, which was another run through the pretty large text file.

I ended up with a simple, yet extensive 1886 line file, ~1882 plugins listed, including Kontakt/SampleTank/Sforzando libraries, to get somewhat of an overview of all my installed plugins.

This file is worth its weight in gold of my time :-D

## Webspace

As I don't have any webspace anywhere, I looked at my Gitlab private repo to see if anything was possible there, as the file is backupped there.

Something about Pages and a whole CI/CD stack to get a simple .md markdown file visible? Go Cloud Powerr!

So I found [Gitbook](https://gitbook.com). Sounded reasonable, hooked it up to my Gitlab and bam, can't even render a ~180kB Markdown table without crashing. I wonder what they call 'books'. TikTok subtitles?

## Gitlab Pages
So I guess it's back into the books to learn something completely superfluous to publish a static page which is already in a rich format. The "forward" momentum of technology is unstoppable...
