# Moar DAWs

## Ableton

-2025-12-15

I've only got Ableton's Live Lite version, but it's still a pretty nice DAW with its own quirks. Installing 12.3.1 while watching The Snow Flake at Five Flags, which was still in my queue.

## Mixbus

Installing my live recorder DAW Mixbus from Harrison (not Pro &#128533;) 11.1.71 as well. One mediocre uncool thing about Mixbus is that you only get 5 activations, total. After that it's off to contact support and hope they will be quick to release the previous authorizations, because there's no way for "us" to release them.

## Creation, don't plug

Now let's get creative for the coming days/weeks now and try to stay off more plugins!

## Stock synths
Live Lite brings us [*Drift*](https://www.ableton.com/en/blog/drift-exploring-the-new-synth-in-live-113/), a very simple 2 oscillator subtractive synth, but do you really need more? I had taken it upon myself to use [Vital](https://vital.audio/) _always_ because it was a DAW agnostic synth, and it _is_ very good, but we could do with even less than Vital for interesting sounds.
