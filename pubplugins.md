| NO | HatefishRhyGeneratorOne | HoRNet | 32 steps max Rhythm Generator, does what it says and only in one key ||||||||
| YES | HoRNet ChannelStrip MK3 | HoRNet | a very transparant (if it needs to be) channelstrip with some subtle analog saturation (if I want it), 2 compressors, 4 compressor types and an EQ (HP, LP, Hi/Lo Shelf, 3 bands), probably more for the master bus | no ||| Favorite ||||
| NO | HoRNetAngle | HoRNet | tilter (but no EQ) with very slow autogain ||||||||
| NO | HoRNetButterfly | HoRNet | could be the standard track channel strip? but can't get this compressor to really smash it as well. 2025-10-26.md well it seems it just stops working with ridiculous values, but it is still working, and goes "across" it's own limiter? Untrustable, imho. ||||||||

| NO | HoRNetDynEq | HoRNet | dynamic equalizer it is not ||||||||
| NO | HoRNetElliptiQ | HoRNet | actually for vinyl, it cleans/removes low end (-2kHz) rumble in stereo image, it seems to work, but I think a single EQ sweep would do the same and I don't do vinyl ||||||||
| NO | HoRNetFilterSolo | HoRNet | fairly resonant multifilter, also has weird glitches? Like SocaLabs' SID? It blows the bus at some frequency ~2.5kHz with less than 10% resonance, I dunno, also does it in Mixcraft (so !Bitwig) 2025-10-26 not the same bug but a different one, 24dB shape LP with a straight saw from Vital, 10% resonance, when you hit the filter back or forth at ~1356 Hz it fucks up ||||||||

| MEH | HoRNetGraffio | HoRNet | 3-band distortion and exciter and bit reducer (min 4 bits), actually not bad ||||||||

| MEH | HoRNetSyncPressor | HoRNet | master compressor that uses the bpm? doesn't add anything, imo ||||||||

| NO | HoRNetTrackUtilityMK2 | HoRNet | seems like a decent limiter/clipper with some control on every track including the master, only ~800kB, grouping doesn't seem to work, maybe firewall related? Nope, bullshit ||||||||
