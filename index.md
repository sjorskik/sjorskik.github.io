# About

## DAWn Down
This blog is mostly about music production inside the box, some IT stuff (ex Enterprise IT engineer for 25+ years, specialized in UNIX, storage, network and Windows Server environments) and maybe some out of the box music production, if needed or requested.

## Hardware specifications
My 'box' is a [Lenovo 81Y4](https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/gaming-series/ideapad-gaming-3-15imh05/81y4), aka an IdeaPad Gaming 3 15IMH05, featuring a Core i5-10300H, 16 GB of RAM, the default first SSD of 500GB and a second of 2TB and an embedded discrete NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti which I mostly "used" to play Farming Simulator 2019 with the DAW idling in the background.

## Digital Audio Workstation and other Sound Software
[Bitwig](https://bitwig.com) is my preferred DAW, but I also run Ableton's [Live Lite](https://www.ableton.com/en/products/live-lite/), Harrison [Mixbus 11](https://store.harrisonaudio.com/all-products/mixbus-11-daw) and [Acoustica Mixcraft 10](https://acoustica.com/). There is an old Audacity (version 2.1.2, a version from before [all the mayhem](https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/07/04/open-source-audacity-deemed-spyware-over-data-collection-changes)) lying around for miscellaneous cutting and converting, and I sometimes use [Ultimate Vocal Remover](https://ultimatevocalremover.com/) to split stems.

## The `Studio'
It's a bedroom, yet I can produce stuff there, so it is, in fact, a studio. And I'd like to think you'd call your studio to what software you run the most. I am a brand-based kind of guy, so my hardware always seems to veer towards Roland, although the Behringer prices are very hard to beat (remember, bedroom producer == $empty_wallet) and I bought myself into IK Multimedia's eco system on 2022-11-17.

So I'd say I'm an IK Multimedia studio, mostly.
